# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other in a browser. The game follows the classic rules where players take turns marking 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all spaces on the board are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game is a draw.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The game is designed to work seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can click or tap on the grid to place their mark.
- **Win Detection:** The game automatically detects and announces when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart Option:** Players can restart the game at any time to play again.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing game logic and interactivity.
